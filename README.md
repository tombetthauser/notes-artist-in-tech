# Scattered Notes from a Visual Artist working in Tech

* I think every artist (including me probably) is a very unhealthy person. We're self-centered, egotistical, we constantly betray eachother. All we want is personal success and attention. There is nothing scalable about what we do or what we want. I can't tell if this is just us or if it's a general fault of human life. In any case realizing this gave me some clarity. I want to be respected by artists, but there's only so much I would do to seek the admiration of such a lost and self-destructive demographic. Myself included?
